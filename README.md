# Mitras
   

#### Installing Mitras
         
```
git clone https://github.com/appasaheb4/Mitras.git
cd Mitras
sudo yarn install  
# for android
npm run android-dev
# for ios   
react-native run-ios   
```   
      

Make sure you have a `.env.dev` similar to `.env.example` in your project's root directory before running Mitras. If this file is absent, you will be faced with a red screen on the iOS Simulator.
